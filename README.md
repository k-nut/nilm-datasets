#NILM-Dataset Collection Readme

The idea behind this repsitory is to have a central, editable collection of NILM (and NILM-like) datasets available.
Those datasets are in the `nilm-datasets.csv` file where they are easily filterable online thanks to github's csv preview.

The initial version includes data from [Oliver Parson's table](http://blog.oliverparson.co.uk/2013/06/comparison-of-public-disaggregation.html)
and the table on page 4 in the [GREEND paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3100v2.pdf).

Feel free to open issues or fork the repository to add more data sets or more fields that are of your interest.
